# studio_windows
PhysiCell Studio for the COVID19 v5 model (for Windows).

For now, we recommend installing the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to have the necessary Qt modules and plotting modules.

Download the latest release, then run this python script from the root folder in a Command Prompt or Powershell window:
```
python bin/gui4xml_with_vis.py --vis
```

# PhysiCell-model-builder
GUI application to generate the .xml configuration file for a PhysiCell model.

## NOTE: This application should be considered "beta". We appreciate anyone willing to try it out and provide feedback. Thanks!

## Directions for contributors: fork the repo, make edits to the development branch, and submit pull requests to that branch.

We recommend installing the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to have the necessary Qt modules and, later, plotting modules.

Download the latest release, then run this python script from the root folder in your Terminal (or Command Prompt) shell:
```
python bin/gui4xml.py
```
